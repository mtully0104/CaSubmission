               <br> Some of the most asked Questions <br><br>We hosts kill race tournaments, here is a breakdown of how they works:
              </h2>
             <p> 
           
                   
                 <li>Enter as many public warzone games as you want with your team during your tournament's allotted time period.<br></li>
                 <li>Every kill you get is 1 point and additional points are awarded based on how well your team places in that game.<br></li>
                 <li> We take the scores (kills + placement points) of your best games to determine your total score.<br></li>
                 <li>The teams with the highest scores win the corresponding prizes.</li>
               
            
            </p>
              <h2>

                  No, you cannot change your platform id before the tournament if you have already registered.
